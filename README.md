# Insectsurvey_2020

This repository documents some basic analyses and data management related to a national monitoring scheme for insects in Norway. It is a working document, and currently a bit rough to parse for an outsider. The data from the project will be publicly available, after we are done with a quality check. GBIF will hold the basic occurrence data of the insects, in an Event-Core format. We might compliment this delivery with another source for the attached environmental data, if this proves to be to much for GBIF to handle.

In any case, this repository will eventually document the steps from downloading the data, to reproducing the analyses and figures in the report.
